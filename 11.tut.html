    <h3>Semantic elements</h3>
    <!-- These are all semantic tags
        <article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>-->
    <details>When approaching which markup to use, ask yourself, "What element(s) best describe/represent the data that
        I'm going to populate?"
        For example, is it a list of data?; ordered, unordered?; is it an article with sections and
        an aside of related information?; does it list out definitions?; is it a figure or image that needs
        a caption?; should it have a header and a footer in addition to the global site-wide header and footer?; etc.
